# Observables-and-Response-Factors
A python script for extracting wavefunctions from the output of the TDHF code Sky3D, written by Maruhn et al. The publication detailing the use of Sky3D can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465514001313. The wavefunctions are used to compute expectation values of observables and nuclear response factors for scattering.
