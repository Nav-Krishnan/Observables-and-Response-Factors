# Observables-and-Response-Factors
A python script for extracting wavefunctions from the output of a static calculation from the TDHF code Sky3D, written by Maruhn et al. The publication detailing the use of Sky3D can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465514001313. The wavefunctions are used to compute expectation values of observables and nuclear response factors for WIMP-nucleus scattering.

The script is given in the file 'Observables and Response Factors.py'. Prior to use, the code must be edited, as detailed in 'Documentation.pdf'.
